This SQL_challenge project aims to structure a company's data using Postgres and pgAdmin tools. The process involved creating a SQL database with tables and defining SQL data types, primary keys, and unique values. The data was loaded from CSV files into the database, and CRUD operations were performed on it. JOIN clauses were also used to combine data from multiple tables. The database schema shows the relationships between tables.

Several data analysis queries were executed, including retrieving employees hired between 1980-01-01 and 1990-12-31, listing the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986, and listing the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee. The manager of each department was also listed along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name. Additionally, the department number for each employee was listed along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B were also listed, as were all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name. Finally, the frequency counts of all employee last names were listed in descending order.
